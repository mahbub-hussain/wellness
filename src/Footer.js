        Based on your self-reported satisfaction within each dimension of
        wellness, indicate the priority of each dimension when it comes to
        optimizing your personal well-being. The next step is using this
        information to begin developing a personal wellness plan and setting
        realistic goals. For the wellness dimensions indicated as "high" or
        "medium" priority, take some time to reflect on your current lifestyle
        and create a detailed list of the specific areas you will activate and
        address.

        Applying a multidimensional wellness approach that considers the WHOLE
        PERSON can be useful in nearly every human endeavor. As a pathway to
        optimal living, wellness is now being activated in a variety of
        associated fields, including health promotion, holistic health, clinical
        care, and multiple “helping professions,” including coaching,
        counseling, consulting, training, and instruction.
